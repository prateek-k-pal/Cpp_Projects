Retro Snake Game:

This is a Retro Snake game made with standard Cpp and Raylib graphics library. The code can be downloaded and you can use it by installing the portable Raylib library in the same folder as the "main.cpp". After that open the "main.code-workspace" file with Visual Studio Code, go to ".vscode" folder, open the "launch.json" file in the text editor and press F5.

If you just want to play the game you can do so by downloading and extracting the Snake_game.zip file and executing launch.exe file. 
The game has two modes - Infinite mode with an endless class black and white snake, and no boundaries. The other one is the Level Up mode, where your snake becomes faster and various colour themes to enjoy the game (total of 5 levels).
