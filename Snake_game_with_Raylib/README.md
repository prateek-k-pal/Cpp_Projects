Retro Snake Game:

This is a Retro Snake game made with standard Cpp and Raylib graphics library. The code can be downloaded and you can use it by installing the portable Raylib library in the same folder as the "main.cpp". After that open the "main.code-workspace" file with Visual Studio Code, go to ".vscode" folder, open the "launch.json" file in the text editor and press F5.

If you just want to play the game you can do so by downloading and extracting the Snake_game.zip file and executing launch.exe file. 

ENJOY THE GAME
